# Leitner Box

Inspired by the resurfacing of the webcomic 'How to learn anything forever', 
I was inspired to create an application for this purpose.

**Goal:** Memorize all elements on periodic table (for starters)
**Method:** Digital Leitner Box

## Leitner box method:

- Every new fact has a card.
- Every card starts at level one, there are 7 levels and a 'memorized' state (lvl 8)
- Every time you get the fact right, the card moves up one level
    - If you get it wrong, the card resets to level 1
    - Once you get it right at level 7, the card leaves the box (lvl 8)

### When do you review cards?

**Level: Frequency**
- 1: 1
- 2: 2
- 3: 4
- 4: 8
- 5: 16
- 6: 32
- 7: 64

How many new cards a day (5-30)

Review cards in order of level magnitude (desc)

Review all level 1 cards until you get them all correct
